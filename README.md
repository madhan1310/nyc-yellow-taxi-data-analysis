# NYC-yellow-taxi-data-analysis
This project performs an exploratory data analysis on the NYC Yellow Taxi trip record data from January 2015 to gain insights into taxi usage and service patterns.

Data Source:
The data is sampled from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission's publicly available trip record datasets. The original data files are very large, so a representative subset of the January 2015 Yellow taxi data is used for this analysis covering areas throughout New York City.

Contents:
The repository contains the following:
SQL code to import, clean and transform the raw CSV data
Queries to analyze the data and derive insights
Summary of key findings from the analysis
Tables and visualizations created in Tableau
Jupyter notebook walking through the analysis steps

Key Insights:
Most taxi rides occur during weekday rush hours, with different traffic patterns on weekends
Manhattan generates majority of the taxi trips
Short trips within a borough are most common, followed by trips between boroughs
Average fare per mile is higher during nights and weekends
Manhattan fares are highest, while outer borough fares are lower

Future Work:
Potential areas for further analysis:
Analyze data from other months and years for comparison
Incorporate weather data to identify effects on taxi ridership
Build predictive models for taxi demand
Compare taxi usage with other transport modes like rideshare services
